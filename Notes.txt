overflow and presention in  int ,real ,float and double
comparitor == and < ,> and && for int and & for binary 
also int ahas rnage of 10^4=
scope(local) and global variable
also contune judt skip one step but break wiil remove it from loop
char cant take 1+ character so we take sting in that case and it is same as python
str[0] is a charter and so it can't take "a" it can only take 'a'
using  getline to take input example of space and cursor and diffrence bet cin and getline
also cin.ignore()
usonfg s.pushback will have O(1) where as doe  s+'f' will have O(s.size())
what is iterration? it's 3 line in code is 3 iterration and for loop one loop will have 3*n if 3 iter in loop so 10^7-1 second  iter in online compiler 
array will have 10^5*(le5) limit so it will show segmentation error
kernal(no read and write which result in sementation fault )
stack(hasd size limit eg 8mb)
memory segment (file mapping and anonymous mapping)
heap
bss segment(unlisted static variable 
data segmen(stastic variable initialized by programe)
text segment(stores the binary image of the process)
void means return nothing
and return means compiled sucess and it will be their in int (function) main 
arrays always pass in reference and don't use or pass 2d arrry directly and in comitative programming use global variable

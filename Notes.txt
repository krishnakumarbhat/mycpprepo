overflow and pressetion in  int ,real ,float and double
comparitor == and < ,> and && for int and & for binary 
also int ahas rnage of 10^4=
scope(local) and global variable
also contune judt skip one step but break wiil remove it from loop
char cant take 1+ character so we take sting in that case and it is same as python
str[0] is a charter and so it can't take "a" it can only take 'a'
using  getline to take input example of space and cursor and diffrence bet cin and getline
also cin.ignore()
usonfg s.pushback will have O(1) where as doe  s+'f' will have O(s.size())
what is iterration? it's 3 line in code is 3 iterration and for loop one loop will have 3*n if 3 iter in loop so 10^7-1 second  iter in online compiler
